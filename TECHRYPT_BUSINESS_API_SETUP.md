## **🎯 EXAMPLE RESPONSES**

### **Restaurant Business**
**Query**: "How will a website help my restaurant?"

**API Response**: "A website will help your restaurant by showcasing your menu with appetizing photos, enabling online ordering for takeout and delivery, building customer trust through reviews and testimonials, and improving local SEO so customers can find you when searching for dining options in Karachi."

### **Legal Practice**
**Query**: "What social media marketing do lawyers need?"

**API Response**: "For your legal practice, social media marketing should focus on establishing expertise and building trust. I recommend LinkedIn for professional networking, educational content about legal topics, client testimonials (with permission), and local community engagement. This helps potential clients see your expertise before they need legal services."

### **Pricing Inquiry**
**Query**: "How much does branding cost?"

**API Response**: "Branding costs vary based on your specific needs, business size, and scope of work. For your business, we'd need to understand your current brand status, target market, and goals. Would you like to schedule a free consultation to discuss your specific requirements and get a customized quote?"
