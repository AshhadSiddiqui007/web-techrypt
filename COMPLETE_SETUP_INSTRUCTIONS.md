# Check if it's set
echo $env:HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY

```

### **Problem: "Business API: NOT FUNCTIONAL"**
**Causes & Solutions:**
- **Internet connection**: Check your connection
- **API key invalid**: Create a new token
- **Rate limiting**: Wait a few minutes and try again
- **Model loading**: This is normal, system will use fallbacks

### **Problem: Slow responses**
**This is normal!** Hugging Face models may take time to load. The system automatically:
- ‚úÖ Falls back to CSV responses (instant)
- ‚úÖ Falls back to rule-based responses (instant)
- ‚úÖ Maintains all functionality
