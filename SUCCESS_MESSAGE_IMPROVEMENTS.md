### **2. Reverted Business Hours Styling to Original**

**Problem**: The blue color scheme added visual clutter and didn't match the overall design.

**Changes Made**:
- ❌ Removed blue background (`backgroundColor: '#f0f9ff'`)
- ❌ Removed blue border (`border: '1px solid #0ea5e9'`)
- ❌ Removed custom padding and styling
- ❌ Removed colored headers and text

**Reverted to Original Styling**:
```jsx
<div className="techrypt-business-hours">
  <strong>Business Hours:</strong><br />
  Monday - Friday: 6:00 PM - 3:00 AM EST<br />
  Saturday: 6:00 PM - 10:00 PM EST<br />
  Sunday: Closed
</div>
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Consistent with overall design
- ✅ Less visual distraction
- ✅ Cleaner appearance
- ✅ Maintains readability

### **3. Improved Business Hours Placement and Sunday Handling**

#### **Business Hours Moved to Top**
**Before**: Business hours appeared at the bottom of the form
**After**: Business hours now appear before the services selection

**New Form Order**:
1. Name and Email fields
2. Phone Number field
3. **Business Hours Information** ← Moved here
4. Services selection
5. Date and Time selection
6. Additional Notes

#### **Enhanced Sunday Handling**
**Added Sunday Detection**:
```jsx
const isSelectedDateSunday = () => {
  if (!formData.date) return false;
  const selectedDate = new Date(formData.date);
  return selectedDate.getDay() === 0; // 0 = Sunday
};
```

**Sunday Warning Message**:
When users select Sunday, they see:
```
⚠️ We are closed on Sundays. Please select another day for your appointment.
```

**Sunday Behavior**:
- ✅ Time dropdown shows no options when Sunday is selected
- ✅ Clear warning message appears
- ✅ Form prevents submission with Sunday dates
- ✅ User is guided to select a different day
